Put your image folders here:

/back/
This folder contains images that are rendered as the card backside images. Put atleast one image inside.

/front/
This folder contains the front side of the cards, e.g. what you are trying to find pairs of in the game. 
There should be atleast 32 unique images if you are playing with default settings. 
Alternatively, you can navigate to ./utils/settings.py and edit the card amount in Cards.amount to change the number of rendered cards for the game. 
This will currently also affect the layout of the game, so no quarantee is given on what it will look like if the amount is changed.

/main_menu/
This folder contains the background images for the main menu. Put atleast one image inside.

/table/
This folder contains the background images for the game table. Put atleast one image inside.
